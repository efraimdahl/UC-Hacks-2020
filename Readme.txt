Purpose of this Readme -> understanding file structure

Main HTML pages:

index.html
charging_basics.html
about.html
solutions.html



contact.php -> Attempt on building a mailer function, using this document http://codechirps.com/php-email-contact-form-tutorial/

All the relevant images and designs (and some scripts) are in the src folder
in the src/css folder are the google-material bootstrap design templates
the src/demo folder includes the custom designs I made for this site.

Images -> All images used for the sites. -> We should probably figure out a way to compress them

-> src/js -> contains necessary scripts

The assets folder contains (to some degree redundant) data for designs and scripts, however I have not touched them, 
so they can be used to return to an "original functioning state"

Notice: All the HTML pages are build for Desktop, we should consider building a mobile friendly Version. 
Perhaps scaling the items and placing them using a dynamic grid.

Anyway: All the best! and thank you for the amazing summer
